📌 Project Overview

This project is a Node.js-based application designed to provide a scalable, fast, and efficient backend solution. It follows modern development practices and uses Node.js to handle server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions. The project structure is simple, modular, and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners as well as advanced developers.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build a backend application using Node.js with clean code, proper folder structure, and best practices. It can be extended easily to support real-world applications such as management systems, REST APIs, or full-stack web applications.

📡 API Usage

The application exposes REST APIs that can be tested using tools like Postman or Thunder Client. Each endpoint follows standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

🧪 Testing

You can add unit and integration tests using tools like Jest or Mocha. Testing ensures application reliability and reduces bugs in production.

📈 Future Improvements

Add authentication and authorization (JWT)

Improve error handling and logging

Add API documentation using Swagger

Integrate frontend UI

Deploy on cloud platforms like AWS or Render
